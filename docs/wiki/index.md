### ADR-001: Separate headless daemon and optional tray UI

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-02

**Context**

The first design was written for Rust, where a separate daemon and UI was an obvious split. Go is lighter, so the question was whether one process (daemon with the tray inside) would be enough.

The reason for the split is not the language. The UI toolkit drives memory use, not the sync engine. `fyne.io/systray` also needs cgo on macOS and system libraries on Linux, while the rest of the stack is pure Go (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no C compiler needed).

**Decision**

Keep two processes:

- `cmd/syncd`: the headless sync daemon, always running (launchd, systemd user service or Windows startup entry). It contains the whole sync engine and is built and tested through the CLI.
- `cmd/syncui`: an optional tray app. It is a separate process that talks to the daemon over a local socket or localhost HTTP (the control API, ticket 33). It is built last (tickets 35 and 36).

**Consequences**

- `syncd` stays pure Go and cross-compiles without cgo.
- A UI crash or quit does not stop syncing, and sync runs with no desktop session.
- The control API is needed anyway for `syncd ctl status`, so the split adds little extra work.
- Tickets 1 to 32 are daemon and CLI only and do not depend on this decision.
- If a single binary is wanted later, only tickets 33 to 36 change. The cost would be cgo in the main binary and a UI crash taking sync down.
